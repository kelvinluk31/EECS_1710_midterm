EECS 1710 MIDTERM


RULES:
This project is a 1 button game thats aim is to shoot cubes into empty
spaces in the gameboard and to fill as many as possible without reaching the top.

you get 10 points for every space filled and 100 for every row filled.
If you go past the top the game is over.

each time a space is filled the space ship's speed will increase slightly and makes it harder for the player to make a precise shot.

HAVE FUN :)
